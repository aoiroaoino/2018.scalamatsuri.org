Free monads and monad monad transformers attract increasing attention from Scala programmer recently. We are also paying attention to Extensible Effect as its extension or alternative.
Dotty the next generation Scala compiler has reached version 0.5.0-RC1 on Dec. 16 2018. It enables use to use attractive new features now.
In this session, I will introduce design and implementation of Extensible Effects that fits the new generation Scala using Dotty's new feature including Implicit Function Types, Dependent Function Types, and GADTs with Type Members, etc.
